                "about": "I am Jawad Bashir Mustafvi, an Erasmus Scholar currently pursuing an International Master of Science in Fire Safety Engineering (IMFSE), building on my foundation in Civil Engineering and my passion for innovation, sustainability, and digital engineering applications. In the IMFSE program, I am studying my first semester at Ghent University (Belgium), with subsequent semesters planned at Lund University (Sweden) and the Polytechnic University of Catalonia (Spain). The location for my thesis will be determined later. In addition to my formal education, I have completed many international online courses, enhancing my extensive research experience and proficiency in various digital tools. I earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Civil Engineering with honors from the University of Engineering and Technology Lahore in 2022, achieving the distinction of being on the Dean’s Honor Roll seven times and receiving multiple merit-based scholarships. Beyond academics, I have gained practical experience through various industry roles. In academia, as a Lab & Research Engineer in the Department of Civil Engineering at the University of Management and Technology Lahore, I developed and taught laboratory courses for undergraduate civil engineering students and contributed to innovative research projects focused on integrating advanced digital technologies into construction practices. I have published several research articles in HEC-approved journals and had the honor of presenting my findings at international conferences. Notably, my presentation at the International Conference on Digital Tool Applications for Cultural Heritage Sites Sustainability (ICDTA-2023) showcased my bachelor's research on preserving Lahore's heritage and evaluating fire risks. Additionally, I served as Director of Management for the Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE UET), an authorized chapter of ICE UK.My research interests encompass fire safety engineering, building information modeling, digital construction, risk assessment, safety management, heritage preservation, extended realities, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.I am Jawad Bashir Mustafvi, an Erasmus Scholar currently pursuing an International Master of Science in Fire Safety Engineering (IMFSE), building on my foundation in Civil Engineering and my passion for innovation, sustainability, and digital engineering applications.

His first paper on the subject, \"Performance of Geopolymer Concrete contacting recycled rubber\", was also published in the prestigious \"Construction and Building Materials\" journal in 2019.\n\nAly's passion for research led him to explore Building Information Modelling technologies in 2020, and he joined the BIM A+ committee as an Erasmus Mundus scholar. In 2022, he pursued an advanced Master's degree from two European universities - Politecnico di Milano (Italy) and Universidade do Minho (Portugal).\n\nIn 2023, Aly began his PhD journey at Rowan University in the USA, where he is also a research assistant. He is part of a research group that focuses on Sustainable solutions for construction, Additive construction and manufacturing (Concrete 3D printing), Accelerated construction and repair, and Low Embodied carbon concrete and infrastructure (low to zero carbon negative).\n\nFor those interested in following Aly's work, here are his Orcid ID, Scopus Page, and Google Scholar URLs:\n\nOrcid ID: 0000-0001-6226-7040\nScoups Page: https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=57206731137\nGoogle Scholar: https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fDyROVkAAAAJ&hl=en\n\n \n              …see more",

                "about": "I had started my career as an architect at Estúdio Sarasá Office, which is specialized in Restoration and Conservation of Buildings, Masterpieces and Monuments. In this company, I had the opportunity to work in large projects and buildings of National importance as Municipal Theater of São Paulo and also with a high qualified multi-disciplinary team.In 2008, I moved to Campinas and I started to work at Portela Rivaben Architects Office (Portela Associate Architects, nowadays) in which I developed architecture projects, I coordinated a team of architects and I held the position of Architect Senior Project Manager working with Projects of Towers. In 2010, I worked at Links Consulting Projects and I developed public projects as Hospitals, Public Medical Centers and buildings that provide services of public interest. Thereafter, in 2011, I've started to work at Porta & Associados Office with the design of buildings and urban areas as well as with the training of a team of architects to work with the BIM technology.In 2013, I received the European Scholarship for develop the Erasmus Mundus Master Degree Program in which I concluded in 2015 with the Honourable Award (A+ Lode). Since I've came back to Brazil,  I've been working with personal projects and architectural projects  in collaboration with some architects and companies. I am looking for an opportunity in which I would like to share my knowledge and experiences, contributing with the grow and development of architectural projects, and, in the same time, learn from other experiences and practices to create from a good quality of works a better reality for all.I had started my career as an architect at Estúdio Sarasá Office, which is specialized in Restoration and Conservation of Buildings, Masterpieces and Monuments.

During this project, I identified key biomarkers and critical pathways in breast cancer by examining large mass spectrometric datasets, utilizing gene set enrichment and pathway analysis. Following this, I pursued my master’s studies in Biotechnology for the Bioeconomy at University of Milan. As an Erasmus exchange student at EMBL Partnership Institute of Vilnius University, I started my master’s thesis on the editing of homologous enzymes, employing techniques such as λ Red Recombineering and Prime Editing to enhance enzymatic efficiency for CO2 fixation. Additionally, I utilized CRISPR-Cas9 for targeted selection. This project has also allowed me to strengthen my bioinformatics skills, applying R for statistical analysis and bash scripting in Linux for homologous protein identification. This experience has significantly expanded my knowledge in enzymatic research and environmental sustainability.After graduating with a Bachelor's degree in Biotechnology from Shahid Beheshti University in 2020, I began an internship where I analyzed proteomics data using a top-down systems biology approach.

Au plaisir de discuter sur l'hydraulique ou tout sujet connexe!Mon expérience professionnelle précédente était très axée sur la conception des systèmes de drainage (ponceaux, réseaux d'égout pluvial, fossés, fossés de crête, drains, bassins de rétention, noues) pour des voies ferrées existantes et nouvelles, cours de triage et des réseaux d'égout pluvial pour le drainage d'autoroutes avec les principaux donneurs d'ouvrage (CN, CP, MTMD). Mon expérience académique portait sur l'évapotranspiration des lacs et milieux humides, mais naturellement je me suis approfondi aussi plus largement sur l'hydrologie globale de ces milieux. Un début de carrière en gestion de projet et surveillance en construction dans le domaine ferroviaire ajoutent un volet pratique à ma méthode de travail en tant que concepteur et chargé de projet.Ingénieur en hydrologie et hydraulique intéressé par tout ce qui touche la gestion des eaux pluviales, particulièrement les infrastructures vertes.

CampbellMy PhD dissertation examines the relationship between native Chinese and Western construction methods in the development of the built environment in Shanghai. This choice of subject stemmed from (1) the concern that building conservation projects in present-day China are being carried out with insufficient understanding of historic materials and construction methods, resulting in a loss of authenticity; and from (2) the lack of any detailed analysis of building construction methods in books about historic Shanghai architecture. The dissertation calls for a better understanding, recognition, and preservation of historic building construction in Shanghai while taking into account the Sino-Western hybridity in materials and building techniques."

I am currently supporting the Offshore Structural Dynamics department at Jörss - Blunck - Ordemann (JBO). My primary responsibilities include the estimation of advanced wave loads through numerical simulations and conducting run-up studies on offshore structures. I also, have a good overview of key design principles, particularly in relation to limit states such as ULS (Ultimate Limit State) and FLS (Fatigue Limit State).In addition to wave loads, I also am passionate about corresponding structural dynamics i.e. behaviour of structure to the loads applied. This is something I learning along the way. I am eager to connect with professionals who share my enthusiasm for offshore wave induced loads.As a Mechanical Engineer and Naval Architect with a strong background in structural mechanics, wave theory and much more.

I am currently supporting the Offshore Structural Dynamics department at Jörss - Blunck - Ordemann (JBO). My primary responsibilities include the estimation of advanced wave loads through numerical simulations and conducting run-up studies on offshore structures. I also, have a good overview of key design principles, particularly in relation to limit states such as ULS (Ultimate Limit State) and FLS (Fatigue Limit State).In addition to wave loads, I also am passionate about corresponding structural dynamics i.e. behaviour of structure to the loads applied. This is something I learning along the way. I am eager to connect with professionals who share my enthusiasm for offshore wave induced loads.As a Mechanical Engineer and Naval Architect with a strong background in structural mechanics, wave theory and much more.
