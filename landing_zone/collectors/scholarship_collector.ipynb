Thus, the project linked to the post-doctoral fellowship aims to deepen studies on the etiology of psychiatric disorders through the evaluation of genomic data from probands and their parents, as well as psychosocial data related to functional impairments in these individuals, such as school dropout and unemployment.\\r\\nThe main activities include creating and managing databases, analyzing data generated from genomic sequencing (exomes and whole genome), conducting GWAS analyses, and calculating polygenic scores. Additionally, the fellow will be responsible for coordinating part of the project, supervising students, and organizing tasks for the execution and development of the project. They will also be responsible for writing/publishing articles related to the project.\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Summary All mental disorders have a genetic etiological basis, and there is a high degree of genetic overlap among them. Moreover, it is known that these disorders lead to functional impairments, resulting in school dropout and/or unemployment. Thus, our hypothesis is that within a community sample, some individuals have greater genetic susceptibility than others to dysfunctional trajectories and mental disorders. We also hypothesize that disorders with an earlier onset may be related to a subtype of disease with a greater genetic contribution, and therefore, with a higher polygenic risk score (PRS) and/or a greater number of non-inherited copy number variants (CNVs). We will also test the hypothesis that the Family Liability Index (collected as a screening tool for subjects' risk at baseline) is related to the parents' PRS, the children's PRS, and their functional impairments and mental disorders.\\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral Objective: Identify variants related to or capable of predicting major mental disorders and trajectories of functional impairments.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpecific Objectives:\\r\\n\\r\\nCorrelate genomic variants (SNVs - Single Nucleotide Variants - and CNVs) and trans-diagnostic PRS with: a. Any mental disorder present in the second wave (age group at higher risk); b. Functional impairments (using the variable \\\"neither working nor studying\\\" vs. \\\"working or studying\\\" in the second wave, the age group at higher risk);\\r\\nCorrelate the age of onset of disorders with the aforementioned genomic variants;\\r\\nCorrelate the Family Liability Index with the parents' PRS, the children's PRS, and their functional impairments and presence of mental disorders (separately and in a mediation model);\\r\\nTest whether the parents' PRS can predict the mentioned outcomes in their children.\\r\\nThe position is open to both Brazilians and foreigners.\\r\\n\\r\\nEmail for interested applicants: See Below\\r\\nPlease specify in the subject \\u201cApplication for PD - BHRC - First Name + Last Name.\\u201d \\r\\nCandidates must submit the following documents:\\r\\n1.
